# Control Statements

Control statements provide the facility to switch the flow of control in a program. Python provides a few control
 statements like `if-else`, `while` and `for`.
 
* `if-else` is for conditional switching of the control.

* `for` and `while` for doing something repeatedly.

Almost all programs utilize these control statements to accomplish the task at hand or to solve the given problem.
